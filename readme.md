# Tableau Practical Projects


## Purpose of This Repository

The **Tableau Practical Projects** repository is dedicated to showcasing real-world data visualization projects created using Tableau. It serves as a resource for data analysts and enthusiasts to explore practical applications of Tableau in transforming complex datasets into insightful and actionable dashboards. By sharing these projects, we aim to demonstrate effective data storytelling techniques and best practices in dashboard design.

## Projects

### 1. Global Hapiness Insights
![Story Overview](https://github.com/datpro12345/tableau-practical-projects/blob/master/Global-Happiness-Insights/screenshot/Screenshot%202024-09-23%20at%2001.11.11.png?raw=true)

This project analyzes the **World Happiness Report (2015-2023)** data to uncover global happiness trends and the factors influencing them. Utilizing Tableau’s interactive Storypoints, the project not only presents comprehensive dashboards but also guides users through a cohesive narrative, enhancing the understanding of key insights. Storypoints were chosen over traditional dashboards to provide a structured storytelling experience, allowing stakeholders to follow a guided analysis and grasp the implications of the data more effectively.

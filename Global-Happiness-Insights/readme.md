## Purpose of This Project

The **Global Happiness Insights** project aims to analyze and visualize data from the World Happiness Report (2015-2023) to uncover global happiness trends and the factors influencing them. This repository serves as a practical example of how data analysts can transform complex datasets into actionable insights using Tableau. By sharing our dashboards and storytelling techniques, we provide valuable resources for those looking to enhance their data visualization and analysis skills.

## Project Overview


This project delves into the World Happiness Report data from 2015 to 2023, highlighting key regions and countries based on their happiness scores. Utilizing Tableauâ€™s Storypoints, we present a cohesive narrative that guides users through the data, offering context and deeper understanding beyond static dashboards. Storypoints were chosen to create an engaging and structured storytelling experience, allowing stakeholders to follow a guided analysis and grasp the implications of the data more effectively.
